Hi and welcome. My name is Michel and I have dedicated the last seven months learning HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript/jQuery, Bootstrap, and version control (GitHub). I've created my website to reflect my experience so far with these technologies. I am currently learning AngularJs and will begin to incorporate this framework into the site. Thanks for visiting and stay in touch at wilbrinkm1@gmail.com
