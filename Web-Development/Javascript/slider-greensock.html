		num0: "A Flood Determination is a document that provides information and confirms the flood status of a specific property. The WTG Flood Determination includes (i) the FEMA Standard Flood Hazard Determination Form that identities the zone and states whether flood insurance is required under the NFIP rules (ii) Visual verification maps that present imagery our experts use in their analysis (iii) Flood Zone legend (iv) Advisory/Preliminary maps (when available) so the property owner can have a 'heads up' to possible future changes in their flood zone.",
		num1: "Yes.  In some cases the report can be used to challenge your current status. There are many properties that have been previously misidentified, where the owner was told they were in a high risk flood zone when in fact they never were. The WTG Flood Determination can be used to challenge these incorrect determinations.",
		num2: "If your property was misidentified (see previous FAQ) and is not in a high risk flood zone, then our report can be used to lower (or remove) your flood insurance premiums. In some cases where there is conflicting information (i.e. you were previously told you were in a SFHA and our reports shows you are not), then the insurer may require an elevation certificate to resolve the issue. We can help guide you with these steps.",
		num3: "Yes. This report is insured for errors and omission to $2,000,000.00 per event.",
		num4: "Under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) rules, you would not be in a high risk zone. If your structure is completely within an X or X0.2% zone, you are considered low to moderate risk and do not require flood insurance. However, our suggestion is that you get flood insurance for the added protection. The premium would be very low.",
		num5: "While there are other reputable companies out there doing flood determinations, our experience is that we have a particularly exceptional and accurate report. The systems we have in place to identify the property and conduct an accurate analysis is the best the industry has to offer. In addition, we offer visual verification and tax maps, so the user can see the data we used in the analysis. Also, the report is insured.",
		num6: "The idea of 'new maps' vs. 'old maps' is a misconception. There are current maps (called effective maps) that we use for the Determination. The 'new maps' that came out after Sandy are Advisory and/or preliminary and cannot be used as the basis for a Flood Determination.  Eventually these advisory/preliminary maps will be made 'effective'. At that time we will use them as the basis for our Determination.",
		num7: "Our clients include Mortgage Companies, Title Companies, Banks, and Insurance Companies. Using these companies ensure that the conclusion of our reports will be honored. If your lender or insurance company does not use the WTG Flood Determination, there could be a situation where our report's conclusion is different from theirs. In those cases a few things could happen. Sometimes out data is so convincing that they change their position based on our report alone. In cases where they don't just accept our conclusion; the next step is often to hire a surveyor to do an Elevation Certificate to resolve the issue.",
		num8: "Yes. Buyers like accurate information about a property they are purchasing. Realtors will often run our Food Determination and have a copy attached to the MLS Listing. This can make your property more attractive in a town that has a reputation for flooding IF the structure is not in a high risk flood zone. Realtors can use our report to increase buyer interest/activity and to fully disclose to interested parties any flood related issues.",

	{
		num0: "Tidelands, also known as riparian lands, are all lands that are currently and formerly flowed by the mean high tide of a natural waterway. Barnegat Bay, a naturally tidal body of water, is an example of tidelands. However, New Creek, a tiny tidal stream that flowed through the city of Newark a century ago but has since been filled in and built over, is also an example of tidelands. New Jersey contains an extensive network of tidelands, both big and small.",
		num1: "The State of New Jersey claims ownership of these tidelands and holds them in trust for the people of the state. All tidelands are overseen by the Tidelands Resource Council, a board of twelve Governor-appointed volunteers, along with DEP staff at the Bureau of Tidelands Management.",
		num2: "Since tidelands are public lands, you must obtain written permission from the state and pay a fee in order to use these lands. Common uses of tidelands include docks, mooring piles, bulkheads and other fill materials. Some (formerly flowed) tidelands may be sold in the form of a Riparian Grant while others (currently flowed) may only be rented through either a Tidelands License or Lease.",
		num3: "The WTG Tidelands Report is a search for the presence of a State tideland claim on a specific property; including a search for any instruments (Grants, Leases, and Licenses) associated with that claim.",
		num4: "",
		num5: "",
		num6: "Yes. Tidelands claims include current and formerly flowed tidal waters. Some of these claims go back more than 100 years. Every county in New Jersey - with the exception of Hunterdon, Warren, Sussex, and Morris - have tideland claims. Some of these claims extend many miles from the ocean.",
		num7: "",
		num8: "",
		num9: "A State Tidelands Claim is a cloud on a property owners title regardless of whether or not that property owner is aware of the claim at the time of purchase. When a property is being sold, the Title Company will run a riparian (Tidelands) report. If a claim is found the Title company may require monies be held in escrow to cover the claim, or that the claim be released prior to sale.",
		num10: "In addition, securing a mortgage will be difficult or impossible until the issues are resolved. If there is a need to petition the Tidelands Bureau for a resolution, that process can take months or even years for final resolution.",
		num11: "",
		num12: "A Tidelands lease, license, and grant are instruments issues by the State of New Jersey.",
		num13: "A Tidelands Lease is a long term rental agreement from the State of New Jersey for the use of its tidelands. Leases are generally issued for projects involving long term financing issues such as houses that have been constructed over currently flowed tidelands or large scale development projects. A Tidelands License is a short term rental agreement from the State of New Jersey for the use of its tidelands. Licenses may be issued for fixed structures, such as docks, piers, mooring piles, floating docks, boat lifts, riprap, and bulkheads.",
		num14: "A Tidelands Grant is a deed from the State of New Jersey for the sale of its tidelands. A grant releases all rights of the state to the current upland owner and relinquishes the rights of the State to that land. In general, the State of New Jersey will only issue a grant for formerly flowed claims.",
		num15: "A Statement of No Interest is an official document issued by the State of New Jersey attesting to the fact that a particular property or area is free from all State tidelands claims, or that the claim is so small or insignificant, the State has no interest in pursuing the claim.",
		num16: "",
		num17: "",
